## Description
This poject was created during my first year at linnaeus university, where I study my bachelor's degree in computer science.

### What is jobb portalen? 
 Jobb portalen is the platform were students are put first. No longer will you have to compete with higher educated or older people with longer working experiences. Here you are the working power that companies need to get a fresh and yunger perspective.

### Why Jobb portalen?
The reason for this project is my dissatisfaction with what the job market looks like today.
I've always been dissatisfied with how the process of applying for a job went
and how unfair the process is for young jobseekers.
Constantly competing against older and highly educated people, leads to fewer jobs left for young workers.
This is why I decided to focus my project on making an application where companies can directly contact and hire young workers.
Where yunger jobseekers can directly create thier CV or personl letter on their profile.
I know how important privacy is for us, this is why you decide who can see your profile. By applying to a job, you give the company access to you personal information.
This also goes for companies. The only information that is public is the information their enter when they create a job post.

### About this app:
This application is just an interface for the rest of the api:s used to fetch and render data. This application does not store any data, it sends all data to the rest-api:s created for specifik tasks. However this application veryfies and sanitizes all data before it is transefered to the api:s. 

### How to use:
If you are a company you can register as one and then post jobs with information regarding these job posts. You can then start/delete a conversation with the applicants of the job posts. You'll also have access to their public profile to read about their educations and previus working experiences. Company account sensitive data will never be public and not accessible by anyone. Only you name and company about information will be used when posting a new job post.

If you are a student user, you chose to register as such. Before you can start applying to job posts you'll have to update your account information (this to lower the spam). After you've successfully updated your account data, you'll now be able to register or remove application from job posts. If a company has written to you, you'll be able to see their messages via "Messeges" link in your profile. Here you have the option to join the chat or to delete the chat.
